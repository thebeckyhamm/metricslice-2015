					<p>What a fun project! I was given the opportunity to build this brand from the ground up, with "Use orange" as my only guidance. I also created the logo as well as other marketing materials.</p>

					<p>This project was the total redesign of a white-label banking application with millions of users.  The old site was 10+ years old and in dire need of an update.  We used client and user feedback to create two design templates, both of them responsive.  A separate admin application allows the admins to configure settings, access, themes and custom colors.  It was built using Angular and C#. The CSS code base was build completely from scratch and is used in conjunction with Bootstrap.</p>
					<p>Tools and software: LESS, Angular, Visual Studio, TFS, and SMACSS principles</p>

					<p>My final project at The Iron Yard.  I lacked motivation and
					accountability when trying to get into an exercise routine,
					so I made an app that I knew would motivate me! Each member
					puts money in a pot, and at the end of the competition, the winner
					gets the cash.</p>

					<p>Sailboat charter and lesson company out of Seattle</p>
					<p><a href="http://lakeunioncharters.com">lakeunioncharters.com</a></p>
					<p>Geoff at LUCA was referred to me through a friend.  His old site was in an old install of Drupal, with a very dark (not very adventurous) theme. We moved his site to WordPress and added a few custom post types and custom meta boxes for his charters, lessons, boats, etc., which made it easy for him and his team to update the site while maintaining consistency throughout.</p>

					<h4>Revenue Analytics</h4> 
					<p>Price Optimization and Revenue Management Experts</p>
					<p>I was an analyst and consultant at Revenue Analytics for my first few years out of college.  When they approached me to redesign their site, I was thrilled to work with them again (and thrilled to take down the site that had been there since the stone ages). The focus of the new site shifted from generalized services to industry-specific services, with custom post types by industry.  Case studies and company news also received a makeover.</p>

					<h4>Evelyn Fore</h4> <p>Gulf Coast Real Estate Agent</p>
					<p>Evelyn received a "deal" on a $300 site from someone else.  After she saw <a href="{{site_url}}/images/evelyn-old-site.jpg">the end result</a>, she came to me and requested that I fix it.  I stripped the CSS and created a simple responsive layout that was flexible enough to work with her real estate listings plugin.</p>
