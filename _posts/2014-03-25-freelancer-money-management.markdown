As a freelancer and contractor, it's important to know exactly where your money is going. My friend Kate runs a [personal finance blog](http://twentiesinyourpocket.com/) and recently asked me to write about my perspective on money management as a freelancer. 

The link is below.  The tl;dr version is "1. hire an accountant, 2. save more than you think you need, 3. running your own business isn't as cheap as you think it will be".

Enjoy!

P.S. My favorite money management resource is [Ramit Sethi](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/)'s book ["I Will Teach You To Be Rich"](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004WL4BW6/) (terrible title, I know), and my favorite bank is [Charles Schwab](http://www.schwab.com/).  They're awesome.  Just do it.
