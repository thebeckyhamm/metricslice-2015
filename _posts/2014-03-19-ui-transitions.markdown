A couple of weeks ago at the [Central Florida Web Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/florida-web-developers/) I gave a talk about UI Transitions.

Lately in my work, I've been adding transitional touches to various elements of the UI, and therefore started notice other people's transitions - both the good and the bad.

I condensed my thoughts on the subject along with some examples in CodePen.

Take a look and let me know what you think!
