I am now in Week 7 of 12 at The Iron Yard. 

I am now recalling the pain involved in learning a new language.

When I was learning HTML and CSS, the pain was along the lines of how to clear a float, or IE8's dislike of a background image.

<br>

Now it's more like how to get the right data to the right view, or why isn't this damn function running.

<br>

But it's the same pain. Same frustration. Same confusion.

<br>


I have to take a step back and remember all of this boils down to: **no pain, no gain**.

I made it through those painful, frustrating, why-am-I-crying-over-stupid-code moments to become the developer I am today. I had to experience them or I wouldn't be, well, experienced. 

As my instructor said, we're "cramming 2 years of failures into 12 weeks".  

<br>

I try to keep that in mind when I realize an hour later that I never *called*&nbsp; that damn function. \*sigh\*
