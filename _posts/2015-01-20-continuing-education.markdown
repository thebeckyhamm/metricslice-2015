The last half of 2014 was busy, as is evidenced by my (lack of) blog posts. I worked on a couple of huge projects, got a dog, went to Korea, and decided to go to code school.

> The more you know, 
> the more you know you don't know.

The above was the conclusion I came to later in 2014.  While I can't have any complaints about my steady work, I want to extend my knowledge to include more front-end dev languages: specifically, JavaScript. 

So I did a LOT of number crunching and a little nail biting before making the decision to pull the trigger and enroll in [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/)'s Front-End Engineering course. I'll let you guys know how it goes. 

See ya in 3 months!
