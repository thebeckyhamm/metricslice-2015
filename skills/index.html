				<h2>Skills</h2>
				<p>I'm a bit of a Jane-of-all-trades.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>UX</h4>
				<p>What good is an application if no one can use it?</p>
				<br>
				<p>I take vague "we want this thing, there" statements and turn
				them into concrete mockups and designs that satisfy stakeholders
				and users alike.<p>
				<ul class="list-unordered">
					<li>My designs have been used by millions of customers (I'm still amazed!).</li>
					<li>My favorite UX book is <a href="https://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">"Don't Make Me Think"</a> by Steve Krug.</li>
					<li>My UX tools of choice are: white boards, graph paper, Balsamiq, Invision, and HTML / CSS.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h4>HTML / CSS</h4>
				<p>Boy do I love to code. I love 4 space indentations, using tags semantically, and not over-nesting my SCSS / LESS. I also have a newfound
				love for BEM.</p>
				<p>Responsive design is my world. I cry on the inside when I see a site that isn't responsive, and fight for those mobile users when a stakeholder says they want to limit access.</p>
				<p>I'm continually trying to improve the accessibility and performance of my sites as well.</p>

				<br>
				<h4>JS / [ insert framework here ]</h4>
				<p>I started my front-end career focusing on HTML and CSS, but JavaScript fascinates me.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>After using jQuery for a while, I took a JS course with The Iron Yard to get further into building apps.</li>
					<li>I created an exercise competition app using React and Backbone.</li>
					<li>I built a demo app in Angular showing real-time incoming messages (using the MQTT protocol) from lighting fixtures.</li>
					<li>And I take every JS opportunity I get because I'm dying to learn more.</li>
				</ul>

				<br>
				<h4>Speaking and Teaching</h4>
				<p>I've taught at two schools: The Iron Yard and Pinellas Technical College. I find teaching one of the most pleasurable ways for me to give back to my community and share my knowledge.</p>
				<p>I also drop knowledge at conferences and meetups sometimes.</p>
