					<h4>What I Do</h4>
						<p>I create custom-designed web applications and sites with the user experience in mind.  I do my best to build things that are beautiful on the inside (the coded guts) and the outside.  I am fantatical about responsive designs: every user should have a great experience no matter what device they use to get there.</p>
						<p>I've worked on small one-man shop sites, and huge multi-million user applications. I tailor my work to your (and your users') needs.</p>
