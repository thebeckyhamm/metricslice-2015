            <h3 class="m-t-1">I know a few things about front-end development:</h3>
            <h4>JS, HTML, and CSS</h4>
			<ul class="list-unordered"> 
				<li>Things I
					<3: AngularJS, Angular, TypeScript (gotta love TS), SCSS, BEM (it's the best for large scale projects)</li>
					<li>Things I've used: React, Backbone, jQuery, vanilla JS, Bootstrap, LESS, SMACSS</li>
						<li>Things I want to use more: Angular, React, Vue, Python</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<h4>UX</h4>
			<p>What good is an application if no one can use it?</p>  
			<br>
			<p>I take vague "we want this thing, there" statements and turn them into concrete mockups and designs that satisfy stakeholders
				and users alike.
				<p>
					<ul class="list-unordered">
						<li>My designs have been used by millions of customers (I'm still amazed!).</li>
						<li>My favorite UX book is
							<a href="https://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">"Don't Make Me Think"</a> by Steve Krug.</li>
						<li>My UX tools of choice are: white boards, graph paper, Invision, and HTML / CSS.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<h4>Other Principles I follow</h4>
					<ul class="list-unordered">
						<li>Responsive design is my world. I cry on the inside when I see a site that isn't responsive, and fight for those mobile
							users when a stakeholder says they want to limit access.</li>
						<li>Accessibility for all people is super important. Contrast, roles and landmarks, aria labels, proper form labelling...the
							list goes on.</li>
						<li>Who wants to wait 30 seconds for 30MB of data to download for a portfolio site? Not I.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					<h4>Speaking and Teaching</h4>
					<p>I've taught at two schools: The Iron Yard and Pinellas Technical College. I find teaching one of the most pleasurable
						ways for me to give back to my community and share my knowledge.</p>
					<p>I also drop knowledge at conferences and meetups sometimes.</p>
